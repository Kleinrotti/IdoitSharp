# Contribution

Thank you very much for your interest in this project! There are plenty of ways you can support us.

## Code of Conduct

We like you to read and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. Thank you.

## Report bugs

If you find something strange please report it to [our issue tracker](https://github.com/OKT90/Idoit.API.Client/issues).

## Make a wish

If you have good ideas how to improve the Idoit.API.Client please let us know! Write a feature request in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/OKT90/Idoit.API.Client/issues).

## Write code

If you like to contribute source code, you will need to clone or download the project [Idoit.API.Client](https://github.com/OKT90/Idoit.API.Client) and then open the solution `Idoit.API.Client.sln` from the downloaded project.

In the solution you are able to create new classes or namespaces for the project `Idoit.API.Client` and if you are finished writing the new code, you can test it by creating a new method in the respective class in the project `UnitTestApi`.

## Run unit tests

To be sure that the code is working as expected you must write a unit test.

For your new unit test you have to do the following steps:

- copy the file `Api.env.dist` to `Api.env`.

- Put your configuration settings to `Api.env`.


You can take a look at unit test example [UnitTestApi](https://github.com/OKT90/Idoit.API.Client/tree/master/UnitTestApi).
